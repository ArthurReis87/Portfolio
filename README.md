## Why not use frameworks?

Although it's clear that frameworks accelerate and assist in the development of any architecture, I believe that using complex abstractions without first understanding the core of a language is an inappropriate shortcut. And since this is one of my first experiences using these languages, I chose not to rely on any external environment for this project. Also, of course, because this is a small repository that doesn’t require highly dense or complex code.

## Internationalization based on JSON files

To enable language switching on the page without reloading or redirecting it, I used `data-i18n` markers on each translatable element in the HTML. This way, upon a click event, the script iterates over language-specific JSON files and replaces the text based on their content.

`<h1 data-i18n="greeting">Olá! Sou Arthur Reis</h1>`

## Behind the code

After being just a regular website user my whole life, I began closely observing the approaches taken by developers of all kinds. The lack of responsiveness, visual clutter, absence of dark mode... I constantly reflect on the bad experiences I’ve had with websites over the years when building my own. With that in mind, I aim to provide anyone who visits my projects with a slightly above-average experience.
